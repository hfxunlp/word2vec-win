# word2vec-win
Google word2vec(https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) tools built for windows compiled with visual studio 2015 on Windows 10 x64.

You could just download a release(https://github.com/anoidgit/word2vec-win/releases) and run it on Windows as the same way on linux.

If you have a large mount of parameters to train(a large number of words or high dimension of embeddings) which means you will need a large amount of memory to use, you'd better use the 64-bit version if the 32-bit version can not work, but for most of the time, 32-bit version is just enough to work.

Because it was built with Visual Studio 2015, you should have Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) installed in your system.
